# 🚀 Building Scalable Data Pipelines with Java Spring Boot and AWS

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building a scalable and efficient data pipeline using **Java Spring Boot** and **AWS services** like Lambda, RDS, and S3. The aim is to create a solution that can handle large volumes of data, process it in real time, and scale according to your needs.

## 📋 Overview

A data pipeline is a set of processes that moves data from one system to another, transforming it along the way. In this project, we utilize Spring Boot for building robust APIs and AWS services for scalable, cost-effective, and reliable data processing.

## 🛠️ Components

- **Java Spring Boot**: Framework for building robust backend services and APIs.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless function service for handling events and processing tasks.
- **AWS RDS**: Relational database for storing structured data.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for unstructured data, such as images, documents, and more.
