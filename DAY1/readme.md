## üìö Overview
This project focuses on building a **serverless power calculator** using AWS services such as **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**. The goal is to efficiently compute powers of numbers (base^exponent) using the power of cloud technology, ensuring scalability and minimal infrastructure overhead.

---

## üöÄ Why Serverless?
- **Effortless scaling**: AWS automatically handles scaling, allowing the application to adjust to varying workloads.
- **No server management**: By using serverless services, there‚Äôs no need to provision or maintain servers.
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for the resources consumed during computation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Services and Tools
- **AWS Lambda**: To run the backend logic, responding to HTTP requests for power calculations.
- **API Gateway**: To handle and route incoming HTTP requests to Lambda.
- **DynamoDB**: (Future Enhancement) Used to store the calculation results along with timestamps.
- **AWS IAM**: Ensures secure and restricted access to AWS services.
- **AWS Amplify**: Simplifies deployment of the frontend for interacting with the API.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. üîê **Configuring IAM Roles**
To securely manage access, an IAM role was set up with permissions to allow Lambda to interact with DynamoDB. The following policy was applied:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/PowerOfMath"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. üóÑÔ∏è Creating the DynamoDB Table
A DynamoDB table named PowerOfMathDatabase was set up with an ID as the primary key. This will store each power calculation result along with the timestamp.

3. üìä Deploying the Lambda Function
The Lambda function was written in Python to handle power calculations. It receives two numbers via API Gateway, computes the result, and stores it in DynamoDB:

```
import json
import math
import boto3
from time import gmtime, strftime

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
table = dynamodb.Table('PowerOfMathDatabase')
now = strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", gmtime())

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    base = int(event['base'])
    exponent = int(event['exponent'])
    result = math.pow(base, exponent)
    response = table.put_item(
        Item={
            'ID': str(result),
            'LatestGreetingTime': now
        })
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(f'Your result is {result}')
    }
```
4. üåê Setting Up API Gateway
To allow public access, API Gateway was configured with:

Method: POST
CORS Enabled: This allows communication between the frontend and backend across different origins.
5. üíª Frontend Development with AWS Amplify
The frontend interface allows users to input a base and an exponent to receive the calculated result. The UI is powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed with AWS Amplify.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Power of Math</title>
    <style>
        /* CSS styling here */
    </style>
    <script>
        function callAPI(base, exponent) {
            let requestOptions = {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
                body: JSON.stringify({ base: base, exponent: exponent }),
            };
            fetch('YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT', requestOptions)
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(result => alert(result.body))
                .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>To the Power of Math!</h1>
    <form>
        <label>Base:</label>
        <input type="number" id="base">
        <label>Exponent:</label>
        <input type="number" id="exponent">
        <button type="button" onclick="callAPI(document.getElementById('base').value, document.getElementById('exponent').value)">
            Calculate
        </button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned
Managing CORS: Configuring CORS properly in API Gateway was key to ensuring the frontend could communicate with the backend without cross-origin issues.
IAM Role Configuration: Striking the right balance between security and functionality in IAM policies was essential to avoid "Access Denied" errors while ensuring secure access to DynamoDB.
Handling Cold Starts in Lambda: Lambda cold starts initially caused delays, but optimizing the function's memory and execution environment reduced latency.
üîó Conclusion
This serverless power calculator leverages the strengths of AWS services to deliver a scalable, efficient solution for mathematical computations. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in cloud security, API management, and serverless architecture.

üìÖ Next Steps
Enhancing the Frontend: Improve user interaction and feedback with a more robust UI.
Logging Calculations in DynamoDB: Implement the storage of all calculations in DynamoDB for future analysis.
Error Handling: Implement more detailed error handling, especially for edge cases like large exponents.
